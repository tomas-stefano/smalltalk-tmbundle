# Textmate 2 Bundle for Smalltalk development

## Installation

You can install this bundle in TextMate by opening the preferences and going to the bundles tab. After installation it will be automatically updated for you.

## Open files

* If you have problems to open smalltalk files, try to click with the right button and select **"Treat files with .st extension as a text"** and dont worry because the bundle will work anyway(You will only need to do this once, IF need).

### Have fun! :)
